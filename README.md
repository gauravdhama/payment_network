# Payment Processing System

This project provides a robust and secure payment processing solution with a wide range of features and integrations.

## Features

*   Payment authorization: Handles payment processing, authorization, and clearing, including ISO 8586 parsing, issuer lookup, 3-D Secure authentication, and pessimistic locking.
*   Settlement: Generates settlement reports grouped by issuer, acquirer, and currency, and sends PDF advisements with bank information and ETA for payment via email.
*   Tokenization: Provides tokenization and detokenization services using ECC.
*   ML scoring: Performs real-time machine learning scoring with Apache Ignite and ONNX Runtime, including asynchronous feature persistence to a Hadoop store with Hive, Impala, and Spark enabled.
*   Rule manager: Allows issuers and acquirers to define rules to block or alert on certain transactions based on transaction parameters.
*   Billing system: Calculates billing amounts for customers based on their billing plans and provides a breakdown of charges by billing codes.

## Architecture

The system consists of several interconnected applications:

*   Payment authorization API
*   Settlement system
*   Tokenization API
*   ML scoring API
*   3-D Secure server

These applications are designed to be deployed in a distributed and scalable manner, using technologies like Docker and Kubernetes.
